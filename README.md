# NNLS
This work builds on an approach first outlined in our paper 'A Single Community Dominates Structure and Function of a Mixture of Multiple Methanogenic Communities' (see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.056 ).The goal was to inspect the microbial community that results from mixing a number of separate (seed) communities and to analyse each seed community's contribution toward the final mixture. 

Samples were sequenced (16S rRNA) to generate an OTU (operational taxonomic unit) counts table
